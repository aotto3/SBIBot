# Bot Commands

All commands are typed directly in Discord starting with `/`. Discord will show you a dropdown with options as you type — you don't need to memorize the exact format.

**🔒 Manager commands** require the Manage Server permission.  
**👥 Anyone** means any server member can use it.

## Meetings

### `/schedule-meeting` 🔒
Schedule a **one-time** meeting. The bot immediately posts an announcement in the chosen channel with ✅ ❌ ❓ reactions for RSVPs. Reminders are automatically sent 7 days and 24 hours before. Posts show start–end time (e.g. 7:00 PM – 9:00 PM) and a Google Calendar link.

| Option | Required | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | ✅ | Company Social Night |
| `date` | ✅ | May 14 · 5/14/2026 · 2026-05-14 |
| `time` | ✅ | 7pm · 7:30pm · 19:00 |
| `channel` | ✅ | #announcements |
| `target` | ✅ | @everyone · @here · Specific members |
| `duration` | optional | 1 hour (default) |
| `reminder_7d` | optional | on (default) |
| `reminder_24h` | optional | on (default) |

> **Target: Specific members** — Use this if you only want to ping certain people. After creating the meeting, use `/meeting-add-member` to add them.

> The Meeting ID appears at the bottom of every reminder post. You'll need it for `/edit-meeting` and `/cancel-meeting`.

---

### `/schedule-recurring` 🔒
Schedule a **repeating** meeting (weekly or monthly). Works the same as above but repeats automatically.

| Option | Required | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | ✅ | Monday All-Hands |
| `recurrence` | ✅ | Weekly · Monthly |
| `day` | ✅ | Monday · Friday · etc. |
| `time` | ✅ | 7pm |
| `channel` | ✅ | #cast |
| `target` | ✅ | @everyone · @here · Specific members |
| `week` | Monthly only | First · Second · Third · Fourth · Last |
| `duration` | optional | 1 hour (default) |

> The creation post is a heads-up only (no RSVP). The **7-day reminder** is when reactions are added for RSVPs.

---

### `/edit-meeting` 🔒
Edit an existing scheduled meeting. Only updates the database — already-posted reminder messages are not retroactively changed.

| Option | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `meeting_id` | ✅ | Shown on the post itself, or from `/meetings` |
| `title` | optional | New title |
| `date` | optional | New date — one-time meetings only |
| `time` | optional | New start time |
| `duration` | optional | New duration |
| `channel` | optional | New channel for future reminders |

---

### `/cancel-meeting` 🔒
Cancel a meeting. Posts a strikethrough notice in the meeting's channel so everyone sees it's off.

| Option | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `meeting_id` | ✅ | Shown on the post itself, or from `/meetings` |

---

### `/meetings` 🔒
List all active scheduled meetings with their IDs, schedules, and next occurrence. Only you can see the response.

---

### `/meeting-add-member` 🔒
Add someone to a **Specific members** meeting. Only needed if you chose "Specific members" as the target when creating the meeting.

| Option | Required |
|---|---|
| `meeting_id` | ✅ |
| `user` | ✅ — @mention them |

---

### `/attendance` 🔒
See a breakdown of who responded to a meeting's RSVP — attending, not attending, maybe, and (for specific-member meetings) who hasn't responded.

| Option | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `meeting_id` | ✅ | |
| `date` | optional | For recurring meetings — defaults to the most recent reminder |

---

## Custom Game Availability

### `/custom-game` 👥
Post a custom game availability check for a show. The bot posts to the chosen channel and adds the correct reaction emojis. Responses are tracked live on the post.

| Option | Required | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `show` | ✅ | Man From Beyond · The Endings · Great Gold Bird · Lucidity |
| `date` | ✅ | April 20 · 4/20/2026 |
| `channel` | ✅ | #mfb-cast |
| `time` | optional | 7pm |

**Post format:**
```
The Man From Beyond
Custom Game Request
@here Is anyone available on Tuesday, April 20, 2026 at 7:00 PM?
Game ID: 42
```

**What happens automatically:**
- Show-specific reactions are added. MFB uses custom emojis `:Dmaybe:` `:Hmaybe:` `:Dno:` `:Hno:` (plus ✅)
- As people react, a live tracker updates on the post showing who responded. MFB shows a **Daphne / Houdini** section breakdown; other shows show emoji-grouped lists with role labels
- Once every role is covered with ✅, the bot **privately DMs the requester** with the cast list
- If unfilled after 48 hours, a reminder is posted in the channel. For MFB and The Endings it pings only the specific unfilled role(s); other shows get `@here`
- The **Game ID is printed on the post itself** — use it with `/cancel-custom-game` if you need to pull the post

**Show reactions:**

| Show | Reactions |
|---|---|
| Man From Beyond | ✅ available · :Dmaybe: Daphne maybe · :Hmaybe: Houdini maybe · :Dno: Daphne no · :Hno: Houdini no |
| The Endings | ✅ available · ❓ maybe · ❌ unavailable |
| Great Gold Bird | ✅ available · ❓ maybe · ❌ unavailable |
| Lucidity | ✅ available · ❓ maybe · ❌ unavailable |

> Role labels (Daphne, Houdini, HR, Author) are pulled from Discord server roles. Mikey and Riley are assigned automatically for GGB and Lucidity.

---

### `/cancel-custom-game` 🔒
Cancel a custom game availability post. **Deletes the original post** from the channel and marks the game closed in the database.

| Option | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `game_id` | ✅ | Printed on the post itself (bottom line) |

---

---

### `/send-shift-reminders` 🔒

|---|---|---|
| `mode` | optional | This week (default) · Next 24 hours |
